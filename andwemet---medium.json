For us, the use of technology is being used around approaches that help our members to take an informed decision.\nOriginally published at https://www.womenwhowin100.com on October 8, 2020.\n\nIt’s Never Too Late To Find Love: The Insider’s Scoop on Dating Apps and Algorithms with Shalini… was originally published in andwemet on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"andwemet","guid":"https://medium.com/p/a0ab83ff103c","categories":["dating","lockdown-2020","marriage","dating-app","relationships-love-dating"],"isoDate":"2020-10-09T10:39:22.000Z"},{"creator":"andwemet","title":"How to Handle Difficult Conversations in a Relationship","link":"https://medium.com/andwemet/how-to-handle-difficult-conversations-in-a-relationship-ddf7c1133bf7?source=rss----493ace355724---4","pubDate":"Mon, 05 Oct 2020 16:11:45 GMT","content:encoded":"<p><em>By Shalini Singh, Founder</em><a href=\"http://www.andwemet.com\"><em> andwemet</em></a><em> in </em><a href=\"https://medium.com/u/7d4ed6557db\"><em>Thrive Global</em></a></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wWgrB0rIcNPKKdu5\" /></figure><p>Happily ever after tends to be everyone’s <a href=\"http://www.andwemet.com\">relationship goal</a>.

You will be happy and in control of your own life.\nOriginally published at https://thriveglobal.in. written by Shalini Singh Founder andwemet\n\nAre You in an Emotionally Abusive Relationship? was originally published in andwemet on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"andwemet","guid":"https://medium.com/p/bb3c968fa07a","categories":["relationships-love-dating","abuse","emotional-abuse","abusive-relationships","online-dating"],"isoDate":"2020-09-18T03:11:15.000Z"},{"creator":"andwemet","title":"How to stop relationship failures from determining your life","link":"https://medium.com/andwemet/how-to-stop-relationship-failures-from-determining-your-life-8a7e53e99387?source=rss----493ace355724---4","pubDate":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 10:56:30 GMT","content:encoded":"<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*APK_5TQESVXik6G40E2zPg.jpeg\" /><figcaption>How to stop relationship failures from determining your life.

What inspired you to launch “andwemet”, and be an author on navigating relationships for Thrive Global?</strong></p><p>The thought behind launching came from listening to unpleasant and frustrating online matchmaking experiences shared by family and friends. These experiences were crystallised post conducting an extensive survey with single urban Indians and by participating in social experiments to gauge the situation and to define the gap. The analysis of results leads us to a single outcome i.e “ <em>lack of trust</em> “ leading to disengagement. This therefore became the cornerstone on which the platform stands.</p><p>As for Thrive Global, a matter of chance interaction that got converted in a regular affair, something which I thoroughly enjoy doing.</p><p><strong>2) Lockdown Love: What is your advice to the single people during this lockdown on finding partners? Now that the lockdown is coming to an end, what do you think the dating scene will look like?</strong></p><p>To be honest finding a partner during lockdown is no different when life was normal, other than the fact that face to face meetings have been replaced with video calls. The lockdown I believe has worked in favour of those seeking love but could not invest for want of time. The lockdown gave them the time to introspect and invest in searching for their prospect partner.

What inspired you to launch “andwemet”, and be an author on navigating relationships for Thrive Global?\nThe thought behind launching came from listening to unpleasant and frustrating online matchmaking experiences shared by family and friends. These experiences were crystallised post conducting an extensive survey with single urban Indians and by participating in social experiments to gauge the situation and to define the gap. The analysis of results leads us to a single outcome i.e “ lack of trust “ leading to disengagement. This therefore became the cornerstone on which the platform stands.\nAs for Thrive Global, a matter of chance interaction that got converted in a regular affair, something which I thoroughly enjoy doing.\n2) Lockdown Love: What is your advice to the single people during this lockdown on finding partners? Now that the lockdown is coming to an end, what do you think the dating scene will look like?\nTo be honest finding a partner during lockdown is no different when life was normal, other than the fact that face to face meetings have been replaced with video calls. The lockdown I believe has worked in favour of those seeking love but could not invest for want of time. The lockdown gave them the time to introspect and invest in searching for their prospect partner. I personally believe that the dating scene did not go through a major shift during the lock down, therefore expect no major changes during opening either.\nThe above being said, for majority of singles, the thought of searching for a compatible companion keeps cropping up from time to time.

Pointing out how your partner can correct themselves implies that they alone are in the wrong. Remember that for any relationship to work it takes two.

recognise. This so because emotionally abusive behaviours are too often and easily normalised by uninformed friends and family not realising it’s not a one-off occurrence and also due to the fact that emotional abuse can be camouflaged in personality traits and preferences of the abusing partner.</p><p>In this context, the victim starts doubting themselves and adopts certain behaviours in order to keep their partner happy. This change in the balance of the relationship happens so subtly and slowly that it can take years for the victim to realise that they are being abused, some may not even realise it.</p><p>Emotional abuse in most cases is a learned behaviour. Many of us learn how to behave in intimate relationships during our growing up years. From our parents or other family members.

This so because emotionally abusive behaviours are too often and easily normalised by uninformed friends and family not realising it’s not a one-off occurrence and also due to the fact that emotional abuse can be camouflaged in personality traits and preferences of the abusing partner.\nIn this context, the victim starts doubting themselves and adopts certain behaviours in order to keep their partner happy. This change in the balance of the relationship happens so subtly and slowly that it can take years for the victim to realise that they are being abused, some may not even realise it.\nEmotional abuse in most cases is a learned behaviour. Many of us learn how to behave in intimate relationships during our growing up years. From our parents or other family members. If the relationship model that was observed growing up is abusive, it is assumed that such behaviour is the norm and therefore acceptable. Emotional abuse can also stem from insecurities regarding body type, skin colour or even professional success.\nWe give below a list of questions (in no particular order) for you to identify whether you are in an abusive relationship. Note: Although more women tend to be victims of emotional abuse, men can be victims too.\nDo you…\n\nFind that your partner is allowed to express anger but you are not?\nFind that you have been slowly isolated from friends and family, people who care about you?\nFind that your partner always finds fault with friends and family?\nFind that your partner often puts you down and/ or blames you for their problems or holds you responsible for others’ mistakes?\nFind that your partner insults you but then says they’re joking?\nFeel apprehensive or anxious often?

Everything you decided you want in a <a href=\"http://www.andwemet.com\">partner</a>. The dates have been fun and he’s oh so charming. You will want to take it to the next level. But… you are terrified. The wounds inflicted by your last alliance have healed but the scars remain. If you desire something more meaningful with this captivating new person, you are going to have to open up about yourself. That means revealing things about yourself that you feel safer keeping hidden. “If I share my fears, what will he think?? What if he runs for the hills? Should I run instead, maybe faster? Isn’t that safer?” Being vulnerable is probably one of the scariest things you will ever do. Without vulnerability there can be no trust, making chances of a meaningful relationship slim. It is what it is. The only way out is through. We are here to ease you in and give you some confidence to take the chance.</p><h3>Dealing with déjà vu: Everyone is not the same.</h3><p>The first and most important thing to remember is that everyone is unique and does not react the same way, especially in the context of <a href=\"http://www.andwemet.com\">intimate relationships</a>. Just because your ex judged you harshly for something you like, doesn’t mean this ravishing person will. If your ex was a stingy miser it doesn’t mean that this person will be that way too. If he was a self-centered, cheating, egomaniac, it doesn’t mean all men are. The best thing you can do is recognize that in front of you is a totally new person. Do not project your fears on him. Red flags will always be red flags but don’t put them there because you are scared. You could start by sharing small details about yourself and check his reaction. If he makes you feel comfortable opening up about the little things, it’s a good start.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*xJeoJCvFBAHycoDK\" /></figure><h3>Work on yourself.</h3><p>Good people come into your life when you feel good about yourself. If your ex has succeeded in doing a number on your confidence and self-esteem, work on strengthening those before you hit the dating scene again. If you are not comfortable with your physical or mental health status, get the professional help you need. When you are happy with who you are, it shows. That is a really attractive trait.</p><p>Be aware! You teach people how to treat you. Decide what your boundaries are. However gorgeous your new man is, do not lessen or belittle your boundaries. If something doesn’t work for you, speak up. If he’s a keeper, he will respect your wishes and you for it plus your confidence in him will grow.</p><h3>Take your time.</h3><p>Chuck all conventional timelines out of the proverbial window. You take your time. Don’t allow anyone to rush you into anything. Trusting someone new, when you have been hurt before, it takes time. It’s a process. The two of you will have to go through it together. This is not a one-way street. You have to show him that he can be vulnerable with you and trust you too. Sharing your scars with each other at your own pace helps build the trust you are both looking for.</p><h3>Taking the plunge: Be prepared for missteps.</h3><p>When you are ready show your deeper scars or the real “imperfect” you <em>the one who likes to eat their ice cream cone from the bottom up) </em>.

Everything you decided you want in a partner. The dates have been fun and he’s oh so charming. You will want to take it to the next level. But… you are terrified. The wounds inflicted by your last alliance have healed but the scars remain. If you desire something more meaningful with this captivating new person, you are going to have to open up about yourself. That means revealing things about yourself that you feel safer keeping hidden. “If I share my fears, what will he think?? What if he runs for the hills? Should I run instead, maybe faster? Isn’t that safer?” Being vulnerable is probably one of the scariest things you will ever do. Without vulnerability there can be no trust, making chances of a meaningful relationship slim. It is what it is. The only way out is through. We are here to ease you in and give you some confidence to take the chance.\nDealing with déjà vu: Everyone is not the same.\nThe first and most important thing to remember is that everyone is unique and does not react the same way, especially in the context of intimate relationships. Just because your ex judged you harshly for something you like, doesn’t mean this ravishing person will. If your ex was a stingy miser it doesn’t mean that this person will be that way too. If he was a self-centered, cheating, egomaniac, it doesn’t mean all men are. The best thing you can do is recognize that in front of you is a totally new person. Do not project your fears on him. Red flags will always be red flags but don’t put them there because you are scared. You could start by sharing small details about yourself and check his reaction. If he makes you feel comfortable opening up about the little things, it’s a good start.\n\nWork on yourself.\nGood people come into your life when you feel good about yourself. If your ex has succeeded in doing a number on your confidence and self-esteem, work on strengthening those before you hit the dating scene again. If you are not comfortable with your physical or mental health status, get the professional help you need. When you are happy with who you are, it shows. That is a really attractive trait.\nBe aware! You teach people how to treat you. Decide what your boundaries are. However gorgeous your new man is, do not lessen or belittle your boundaries. If something doesn’t work for you, speak up. If he’s a keeper, he will respect your wishes and you for it plus your confidence in him will grow.\nTake your time.\nChuck all conventional timelines out of the proverbial window. You take your time. Don’t allow anyone to rush you into anything. Trusting someone new, when you have been hurt before, it takes time. It’s a process. The two of you will have to go through it together. This is not a one-way street. You have to show him that he can be vulnerable with you and trust you too. Sharing your scars with each other at your own pace helps build the trust you are both looking for.\nTaking the plunge: Be prepared for missteps.\nWhen you are ready show your deeper scars or the real “imperfect” you the one who likes to eat their ice cream cone from the bottom up) . The reaction you receive may not be what you hoped for. That’s ok. Be brave. Don’t panic. Talk about it. By no means do you need to justify anything, if you don’t want to. But attempting to understand the reason for the undesirable reaction (with an open mind and not from your “I knew this would happen” place) can help you communicate better and strengthen the bond you are both trying to build. On the other hand, getting the response you are hoping for is wonderful and will give you the confidence to move ahead with your man.\nWe hope you find these pointers useful and use them to get the relationship you want.

Pointing out how your partner can correct themselves implies that they alone are in the wrong. Remember that for any relationship to work it takes two.

Perhaps, one day both of you will grow to see each other’s perspectives joyfully.\nUrban Indian, looking to start your love story with an imperfectly perfect life partner — sign up on www.andwemet.com\n\nEmbracing each other’s perspective was originally published in andwemet on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"andwemet","guid":"https://medium.com/p/7b588fedcc5c","categories":["patience","love","embrace","dating","relationships-love-dating"],"isoDate":"2020-10-24T05:34:45.000Z"},{"creator":"andwemet","title":"Tips to maintain a long distance relationship","link":"https://medium.com/andwemet/tips-to-maintain-a-long-distance-relationship-323f7bedc441?source=rss----493ace355724---4","pubDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 06:49:03 GMT","content:encoded":"<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CyaBsh-Q-9afi9cQiW7thQ.jpeg\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/827/1*1Erv5uYa2584pNcfEE_xug.jpeg\" /><figcaption>it is ok to be the <a href=\"http://www.andwemet.com\">first to apologize</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/827/1*kJL_xDhXocwAWk4gmZlh3g.jpeg\" /><figcaption><a href=\"http://www.andwemet.com\">patience will be needed in huge abundance for a long distance relationship</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/827/1*1JlkI_EVBCHlNS2tt-z1SQ.jpeg\" /><figcaption>You have to meet in person</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/827/1*-TqTHODZ5BFkaVvyWwMQaw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>This works well always</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/827/1*5YTvZjIaHsFHo8XoayR-rA.jpeg\" /><figcaption><a href=\"http://www.andwemet.com\">communicate</a> communicate in a relationship</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/827/1*wo4ZvWwxD6aqp0cKF4683Q.jpeg\" /><figcaption>you need to have a road-map, a plan about <a href=\"http://www.andwemet.com\">living together</a> at some point in time</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*Tf8teyIn4bVklmpu13RDzg.jpeg\" /><figcaption>sign up now — <a href=\"http://andwemet.com\">www.andwemet.com</a></figcaption></figure><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=323f7bedc441\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/andwemet/tips-to-maintain-a-long-distance-relationship-323f7bedc441\">Tips to maintain a long distance relationship</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/andwemet\">andwemet</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"it is ok to be the first to apologizepatience will be needed in huge abundance for a long distance relationshipYou have to meet in personThis works well alwayscommunicate communicate in a relationshipyou need to have a road-map, a plan about living together at some point in timesign up now — www.andwemet.com\nTips to maintain a long distance relationship was originally published in andwemet on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"andwemet","guid":"https://medium.com/p/323f7bedc441","categories":["couples","love","long-distance","relationships-love-dating","india"],"isoDate":"2020-10-16T06:49:03.000Z"},{"creator":"andwemet","title":"#Dating: How to trust after being cheated on | Urban Asian","link":"https://medium.com/andwemet/dating-how-to-trust-after-being-cheated-on-urban-asian-a4ebd41b9fed?source=rss----493ace355724---4","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 12:11:48 GMT","content:encoded":"<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HgcembyH8oEn3h4CIu1AZA.jpeg\" /><figcaption>How to trust after being cheated on</figcaption></figure><p><em>(this piece is written from the perspective of a heterosexual female but please feel free to apply it your specific context)</em></p><p>He has checked all your boxes.

In reality, all relationships face challenges at various stages of the journey. The challenges can be external like an interfering family or internal to the individuals like insecurity. How the couple handles these challenges can be defining to the relationship.</p><p>Each of us has our own individual personality. Some of which is inherent and some of which is shaped by life experiences. We tend to approach relationship challenges with the assumptions we hold from our past experiences. When both partners adopt this approach, the situation can turn volatile and toxic very quickly. Reactions can swing from extremely emotional to reserved calm where a partner internalises their emotions and does not react at all in the moment only to erupt later on</p><p>We are human and emotions are a part of us that we cannot easily control all the time. The truth is that issues need to be aired and discussed to keep the relationship healthy and moving forward. Sweeping them under the carpet or otherwise neglecting them is a surefire recipe for relationship disaster that can hurt more people than just the couple in question.</p><p>So, here are a few expert tips for times when you feel you are facing a challenge or being put in a compromised position in your <a href=\"http://www.andwemet.com\">relationship</a>:</p><p><strong>1. Handle the situation with emotion but not emotionally.</strong> This is easier said than done. Try to be sensitive to your partner’s feelings and to not take their words personally. Sometimes, it may not be about you but an external stress that just comes out wrong. Becoming upset, angry or emotional clouds your judgment and you may lose control of your reactions and words. Never a good thing and you will regret it later.</p><p><strong>2. Do not take any decision in the heat of the moment.</strong> This is a universal no-no. Practise the pause. Stop talking. Take a moment to breathe. Walk away if you must. But do not declare ultimatums or final decision during an argument. This can cost you the loss of a relationship which you value otherwise.</p><p><strong>3. Reflect, introspect and try to be empathetic and rational.</strong> This is important because honest self-reflection can open your eyes to the root cause of the contentious issue. Reflect on why and how the differences came about and what you can do to correct them. ‘You’ is the operative word here. Pointing out how your partner can correct themselves implies that they alone are in the wrong. Remember that for any relationship to work it takes two. Absolving yourself of any responsibility is selfish. As you reflect on the issue, put it in the context of the relationship and why the relationship holds value for you. The ability to apologise and forgive is important to learn if maintaining the relationship is valuable to you.</p><p>Couples in a<a href=\"http://www.andwemet.com\"> healthy relationship</a> communicate with their partner in a non-confrontational way. Making the conversation about the issue at hand and not a personal attack. They also let go of issues without holding a grudge. Not raking up a past grievance in a current discussion. Internalising emotions leads to passive aggressive behaviour and can kill otherwise compatible relationships.</p><p>No relationship is free of challenges, disagreements, or debates. Everyone makes mistakes and accidents happen. One partner may falter and become insensitive in some situations. If that is you, it’s best to apologise and be committed to not repeating the folly in the future. If it’s your partner, forgive them and move on. When new challenges arrive, you will be in a better space to deal with them together. <a href=\"http://www.andwemet.com\">Communicate with each other</a>, appreciate each other. Work together to build a relationship that can weather any storm.</p><p>And may we say as we always do, take an appointment with a specialist or a therapist if the issue cannot be resolved between the couple.</p><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href=\"https://thriveglobal.in/stories/how-to-handle-difficult-conversations-in-a-relationship/\"><em>https://thriveglobal.in</em></a><em>.</em></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ddf7c1133bf7\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/andwemet/how-to-handle-difficult-conversations-in-a-relationship-ddf7c1133bf7\">How to Handle Difficult Conversations in a Relationship</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/andwemet\">andwemet</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"By Shalini Singh, Founder andwemet in Thrive Global\n\nHappily ever after tends to be everyone’s relationship goal.

Reactions can swing from extremely emotional to reserved calm where a partner internalises their emotions and does not react at all in the moment only to erupt later on\nWe are human and emotions are a part of us that we cannot easily control all the time. The truth is that issues need to be aired and discussed to keep the relationship healthy and moving forward. Sweeping them under the carpet or otherwise neglecting them is a surefire recipe for relationship disaster that can hurt more people than just the couple in question.\nSo, here are a few expert tips for times when you feel you are facing a challenge or being put in a compromised position in your relationship:\n1. Handle the situation with emotion but not emotionally. This is easier said than done. Try to be sensitive to your partner’s feelings and to not take their words personally. Sometimes, it may not be about you but an external stress that just comes out wrong. Becoming upset, angry or emotional clouds your judgment and you may lose control of your reactions and words. Never a good thing and you will regret it later.\n2. Do not take any decision in the heat of the moment. This is a universal no-no. Practise the pause. Stop talking. Take a moment to breathe. Walk away if you must. But do not declare ultimatums or final decision during an argument. This can cost you the loss of a relationship which you value otherwise.\n3. Reflect, introspect and try to be empathetic and rational. This is important because honest self-reflection can open your eyes to the root cause of the contentious issue. Reflect on why and how the differences came about and what you can do to correct them. ‘You’ is the operative word here. Pointing out how your partner can correct themselves implies that they alone are in the wrong. Remember that for any relationship to work it takes two. Absolving yourself of any responsibility is selfish. As you reflect on the issue, put it in the context of the relationship and why the relationship holds value for you. The ability to apologise and forgive is important to learn if maintaining the relationship is valuable to you.\nCouples in a healthy relationship communicate with their partner in a non-confrontational way. Making the conversation about the issue at hand and not a personal attack. They also let go of issues without holding a grudge. Not raking up a past grievance in a current discussion. Internalising emotions leads to passive aggressive behaviour and can kill otherwise compatible relationships.\nNo relationship is free of challenges, disagreements, or debates. Everyone makes mistakes and accidents happen. One partner may falter and become insensitive in some situations. If that is you, it’s best to apologise and be committed to not repeating the folly in the future. If it’s your partner, forgive them and move on. When new challenges arrive, you will be in a better space to deal with them together. Communicate with each other, appreciate each other. Work together to build a relationship that can weather any storm.\nAnd may we say as we always do, take an appointment with a specialist or a therapist if the issue cannot be resolved between the couple.\nOriginally published at https://thriveglobal.in.\n\nHow to Handle Difficult Conversations in a Relationship was originally published in andwemet on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"andwemet","guid":"https://medium.com/p/ddf7c1133bf7","categories":["indian","love","difficult-conversations","relationships-love-dating","relationships"],"isoDate":"2020-10-05T16:11:45.000Z"},{"creator":"andwemet","title":"Should I apologise when I am not at fault?","link":"https://medium.com/andwemet/should-i-apologise-when-i-am-not-at-fault-dcf2b018493d?source=rss----493ace355724---4","pubDate":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 03:58:15 GMT","content:encoded":"<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AC9WlkoldUvUGNVB6j2Wog.jpeg\" /><figcaption>apologies I disagreements I relationship I andwemet</figcaption></figure><p><em>team andwemet</em></p><p><em>“I love my partner.

You can choose to ignore the labels and popular norms! Think of a breakup as a positive experience. Realize that a breakup is just one of your life experiences and that you can learn and grow from it. Look at it is a rite of passage, as a chance to learn more about yourself and what kind of relationship will make you happy in the future. Your friends, family and society cannot tell you what works for you. This is something we all must determine on our own. Working this out is not a static experience. It is a dynamic process and it takes time. Usually it’s a trial and error process that may have to be repeated many times. Like learning to walk or ride a bike.</p><p>The important thing to always keep in mind is that our life is made up of so many different experiences. Some good, some not so good and some amazing! <em>C’est la vie!</em> It’s a roller coaster! if you don’t let the failure define you then comments from other’s don’t bother you. If you own it, it takes away the power of other’s judgment towards you.

Rather than playing the blame game it’s important to recognize it and is not fair to either person to stay in the relationship when they are not happy and their issues cannot be resolved.\nOne break up or even a series of break ups does not define you or determine your future unless…YOU allow it to.\nOne break up or even a series of break ups does not define you or determine your future unless…YOU allow it to.You have the power to change your perspective. You can choose to ignore the labels and popular norms! Think of a breakup as a positive experience. Realize that a breakup is just one of your life experiences and that you can learn and grow from it. Look at it is a rite of passage, as a chance to learn more about yourself and what kind of relationship will make you happy in the future. Your friends, family and society cannot tell you what works for you. This is something we all must determine on our own. Working this out is not a static experience. It is a dynamic process and it takes time. Usually it’s a trial and error process that may have to be repeated many times. Like learning to walk or ride a bike.\nThe important thing to always keep in mind is that our life is made up of so many different experiences. Some good, some not so good and some amazing! C’est la vie! It’s a roller coaster! if you don’t let the failure define you then comments from other’s don’t bother you. If you own it, it takes away the power of other’s judgment towards you. So shake off that f-word and get back on the ride that is life. Keep looking forward and remember…the choice is always, always yours!\nUrban Indian looking for an online matchmaking service for committed relationship -Sign up now.\n\nHow to stop relationship failures from determining your life was originally published in andwemet on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"andwemet","guid":"https://medium.com/p/8a7e53e99387","categories":["failure","indian","online-dating","relationships-love-dating","love"],"isoDate":"2020-09-17T10:56:30.000Z"},{"creator":"andwemet","title":"Embracing each other’s perspective","link":"https://medium.com/andwemet/embracing-each-others-perspective-7b588fedcc5c?source=rss----493ace355724---4","pubDate":"Sat, 24 Oct 2020 05:34:45 GMT","content:encoded":"<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wjlQFPtk9IGzFj_PeHiJUQ.jpeg\" /><figcaption>a ‘doable’ tip to strengthen your relationship…</figcaption></figure><p><em>by Dr Parul Bansal</em></p><p>Humans are social beings.

If we consider this, the decisions made are based on emotions and the initial euphoria may cloud the judgment.

We aim to help people make an informed decision through our app.</p><p><strong>6) Dating Algorithms: What are some common glitches you see in mass market dating algos, and how have you worked to mitigate this for your clients?</strong></p><p>Love this question. From my perspective I see technology to act only as an enabler that certainly helps in the hygiene factors aiding users, but I think that is where it stops. Technology that works on data and gauging personality traits through only data is yet to reach maturity (may never reach as it is about understanding the human mind and emotions) to help give ‘perfect’ match. I believe for technology to aid a successful relationship you need unstated information, which is difficult to be converted into actionable data. For us, the use of technology is being used around approaches that help our members to take an informed decision.</p><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href=\"https://www.womenwhowin100.com/blog/shalini-singh-finding-love-late-dating-apps-and-we-met?fbclid=IwAR22lGx4C3gwtwkaDvPKrXC4lqzhnIqT8EoBf1Ix1AWONPqGp9kH55aCafU\"><em>https://www.womenwhowin100.com</em></a><em> on October 8, 2020.</em></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a0ab83ff103c\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/andwemet/its-never-too-late-to-find-love-the-insider-s-scoop-on-dating-apps-and-algorithms-with-shalini-a0ab83ff103c\">It’s Never Too Late To Find Love: The Insider’s Scoop on Dating Apps and Algorithms with Shalini…</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/andwemet\">andwemet</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"It’s Never Too Late To Find Love: The Insider’s Scoop on Dating Apps and Algorithms with Shalini Singh — Women Who Win #Dreamcatchers\n\n1) Tell us your story.

Relationships in all honesty are extremely personal that involve emotions.\nAs for the sacrifices that you talk about, I would address it by saying that every long-lasting relationship is a TRAP (Trust, Respect, Acceptance & Patience) and couples have their own thresholds.\n5) What are the most common dating pitfalls you see, and how does this vary between age groups/cultures?\nDispassionately thinking dating is defined by emotions and not logic, this happens across age groups and cultures. If we consider this, the decisions made are based on emotions and the initial euphoria may cloud the judgment. Therefore, it is important to introspect before diving completely in and I must admit that it is easier said than done. We aim to help people make an informed decision through our app.\n6) Dating Algorithms: What are some common glitches you see in mass market dating algos, and how have you worked to mitigate this for your clients?\nLove this question. From my perspective I see technology to act only as an enabler that certainly helps in the hygiene factors aiding users, but I think that is where it stops. Technology that works on data and gauging personality traits through only data is yet to reach maturity (may never reach as it is about understanding the human mind and emotions) to help give ‘perfect’ match. I believe for technology to aid a successful relationship you need unstated information, which is difficult to be converted into actionable data. For us, the use of technology is being used around approaches that help our members to take an informed decision.\nOriginally published at https://www.womenwhowin100.com on October 8, 2020.\n\nIt’s Never Too Late To Find Love: The Insider’s Scoop on Dating Apps and Algorithms with Shalini… was originally published in andwemet on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"andwemet","guid":"https://medium.com/p/a0ab83ff103c","categories":["dating","lockdown-2020","marriage","dating-app","relationships-love-dating"],"isoDate":"2020-10-09T10:39:22.000Z"},{"creator":"andwemet","title":"How to Handle Difficult Conversations in a Relationship","link":"https://medium.com/andwemet/how-to-handle-difficult-conversations-in-a-relationship-ddf7c1133bf7?source=rss----493ace355724---4","pubDate":"Mon, 05 Oct 2020 16:11:45 GMT","content:encoded":"<p><em>By Shalini Singh, Founder</em><a href=\"http://www.andwemet.com\"><em> andwemet</em></a><em> in </em><a href=\"https://medium.com/u/7d4ed6557db\"><em>Thrive Global</em></a></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wWgrB0rIcNPKKdu5\" /></figure><p>Happily ever after tends to be everyone’s <a href=\"http://www.andwemet.com\">relationship goal</a>.

Once they feel that you are under their control again, they will revert to their old ways. If you choose to stay in the relationship or go back after leaving, do not blame yourself. You are not weak. Understand that you need the time to work on gathering the strength to stand up for yourself or leave. It is not uncommon if it takes upto five (or more) attempts to finally leave the relationship for good.\nUndoubtedly, leaving the relationship is a very hard choice to make initially. But it is a necessary one for your own long term health and safety. Whether you stay in the relationship or not, seek support from people you can really trust and are not judgmental (they may not necessarily be family members). Go for therapy or join a support group. Take time to heal yourself. You will be able to rebuild your confidence and grow to love yourself. You will be happy and in control of your own life.\nOriginally published at https://thriveglobal.in. written by Shalini Singh Founder andwemet\n\nAre You in an Emotionally Abusive Relationship? was originally published in andwemet on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"andwemet","guid":"https://medium.com/p/bb3c968fa07a","categories":["relationships-love-dating","abuse","emotional-abuse","abusive-relationships","online-dating"],"isoDate":"2020-09-18T03:11:15.000Z"},{"creator":"andwemet","title":"How to stop relationship failures from determining your life","link":"https://medium.com/andwemet/how-to-stop-relationship-failures-from-determining-your-life-8a7e53e99387?source=rss----493ace355724---4","pubDate":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 10:56:30 GMT","content:encoded":"<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*APK_5TQESVXik6G40E2zPg.jpeg\" /><figcaption>How to stop relationship failures from determining your life.
